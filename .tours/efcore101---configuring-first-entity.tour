They're embedded within your domain models and provide a declarative way to specify database mapping rules. These attributes are included in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations and System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema namespaces.",

It provides a more flexible and powerful way to define your data models in the OnModelCreating method of your DbContext. This approach allows you to override the OnModelCreating method on your context to further configure the model that was discovered by convention.",

This approach is more maintainable as you add new entities because it eliminates the need to manually register each configuration class - they're discovered automatically through reflection.",
